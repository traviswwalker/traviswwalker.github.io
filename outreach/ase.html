Midsummer Conference
<ul>
<li>2017: 3D Printing the Future</li>
<ul>
<li>See the science behind the magic of 3D printing. Students will get a formal introduction to 3D printing, and to the capabilities of OSU’s own Rheology Lab, and see the Lab in action. Then, students will learn how a 3D scanner works to bring an object into the computer. Finally, students will get into small groups to use free 3D-modeling software called SketchUp to create a model of a printable object.</li>

<li>2014: 3D Printing the Future</li>
<ul>
<li>See the science behind the magic in this introduction to 3D printing technology in the Rheology Lab at OSU. Students will get a formal introduction to 3D printing and the capabilities of the Rheology Lab, while starting a print so that the participants can see the process in action. Next, students will learn how the 3D scanner works to bring an image of an object into the computer. Finally, in small groups, students will use a free 3D modeling software (SketchUp) to create a model of something that they 
would like to print. Students registered for this workshop may want to think of a shape that they would like to model before the conference.</li>
