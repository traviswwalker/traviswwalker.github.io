The push for STEM, which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, is needed in this day and age more than ever before. Getting kids interested in STEM is important for their mental development and problem solving skills. My interest was starting at the youngest levels and getting them interested. Peopleâ€™s minds are less open the older they get, so starting young is imperative. I wanted to do a simple activity that could be creative, the kids could do themselves, something they could show others, and something that would make them learn. I saw an activity online that would be perfect and modified it to do on a larger scale. Using a computer program, I was able to modify the activity and expand on the initial idea. I believe this is a fun activity for children, and that it is an activity that will open their minds to the creativity used in STEM.
