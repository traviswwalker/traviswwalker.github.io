The goal for this project was to develop an interactive and fun activity for students grades K-12 for use at different outreach events. “Scanimation!” is an activity that allows students to create their very own animations via the use of a grid printed on an overhead transparent and specially designed images printed on regular 8.5”x11” printer paper. The “Scanimation!” activity was designed to teach students about the technology behind the development of animation and moving pictures as well as provide an fun optical illusion that they can take home and show their friends and family.
