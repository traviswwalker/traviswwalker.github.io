The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the principles of drag and aerodynamics in a digestible manner to K-12 students. This objective was completed by creating a model wind tunnel that is testable for small models of vehicles and other objects. The apparatus was designed for maximum visibility of air flow and disruptions for a crowd of people. The device was constructed using a fan that pushes dry ice smoke through a clear, five inch diameter, acrylic tube. The fan was made to be removable, allowing for swapping out of cars in the center of the tube. Though small in size and relatively cheap with materials, the demonstration illustrates drag and aerodynamics well. The apparatus exhibits behavior similar to much more grandeur wind tunnels.
