As technology is advancing in todayâ€™s age, more jobs are opening up in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, and more people are needed in these fields. Along with the need for more workers in these fields, STEM is always expanding on amazing discoveries, and it is just wonderful in general. To make sure that the world fills the needs in these job fields, and to get the public interested in the cool outcomes of the STEM fields, we need to start early with the amazement and wonder of discovery. My project focuses on young kids specifically and gives them a simple activity that they not only have fun completing but also start to learn the basics of STEM and the phenomena that is physics. Using my prior knowledge and expanding on it with designs found from other people, I was able to create my project of a paper airplane building and flying competition for young kids. While the project is geared toward little kids, people of all ages will still enjoy the activity, even though they have already learned the STEM material presented in this project. I believe this project is a good starting place for introducing kids into the STEM field and showing them that even the simplest things in life are incorporated in the STEM field.
