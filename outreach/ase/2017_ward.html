<h2>2016: Emulated Synthetic Biofluid Production and Characterization</h2>

<p>The Walker Group develops theoretical and experimental methods for studying complex fluids, soft solids, miscible fluid interactions, and biological systems. We are interested in multiphase systems and mechanics of materials. Our ultimate goal is to provide detailed insight into the macroscopic characteristics of materials and processes through an in-depth understanding of fundamental molecular-level physics. The internship will support Oregon State Universityâ€™s Rheology Research Group to investigate a wide variety of medical conditions, ranging from cystic fibrosis and COPD in humans to lameness in horses, as well as consumer products such as novel 3D printing filament and soft composites for high-speed data transmission. The intern in this position will have the chance to assist with a number of investigations in the Rheology Research Group that are in need of identifying (or inventing), making, and characterizing complex fluids including biofluids (e.g., blood, mucus), biofilms, consumer products (e.g., inks, cosmetics), and more. The intern selected for this position will work within a team atmosphere to help graduate and undergraduate students in the Rheology Research Group characterize the physical properties of interesting materials that live at the interface between solids and liquids (e.g., silly putty).  The Rheology Research Group has a wide array of state-of-the-art molecular, rheological, surface, and thermal characterization techniques in its facilities to aid in characterizing materials. Basic coursework in chemistry, physics, and mathematics.  The intern must wear closed-toed shoes in the lab. Women and students from diverse backgrounds, first generation college-bound students, and low-income students are encouraged to apply for this position.</p>
