<p>Help the Rheology Research Group at Oregon State University investigate a wide variety of medical conditions from cystic fibrosis and COPD in humans to lameness in horses. The intern in this position will have the chance to assist with a number of investigations in the Rheology Research Group that are in need of identifying (or inventing,) making, and characterizing synthetic biofluids that are mechanically similar to the real fluids. The intern selected for this position will work within a team atmosphere to help graduate students in the Rheology Research Group create identified candidates and characterize their physical properties to compare with real biofluid samples. These synthetic biofluids will become the foundation for the group as they investigate how the mechanical properties of the biofluids affect susceptibilities and treatments for individuals with the condition of interest. The Rheology Research Group has a wide array of state-of-the-art molecular, rheological, surface, and thermal characterization techniques in its facilities to aid in characterizing these synthetic biofluids. The intern must wear closed-toed shoes in the lab. Women and students from diverse backgrounds, first generation college-bound students, and low-income students are encouraged to apply for this position.</p>
