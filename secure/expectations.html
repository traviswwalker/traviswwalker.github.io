In an effort to be both efficient and effective in the dissemination of our work, the following items will be expected for any person working directly under my supervision on any work that has me included on the work. 

<br />
<br />

In practice, I will be updating the website to include templates for these items.  In the intermediate, feel free to ask me (or others) for help in getting the documents to work the way that I have asked.  If you have updates or suggestions for making improvements to the process, please let me know. 

<br />
<br />

Please read and use the following <a href="/secure/pdfs/publications/training/whitesides2004whitesides.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by George Whitesides as a general guideline in your research on how to use outlines for future manuscripts, presentations, reports, etc.
 
<h2>Results</h2>

In general, we need to be diligent in our efforts to publish reproducible results.  Please read and use the following <a href="/secure/pdfs/publications/training/sholl2019five.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by David Sholl as a general guideline in your research on how to disseminate reproducible results for future manuscripts, presentations, reports, etc.

<br /><br />

All of your results should be appropriately plotted, meaning that you should make the effort to replot the raw data.

<br /><br />

Further, if you happen to be presenting rheological data, I highly suggest that you read and use the following <a href="/secure/pdfs/publications/training/ewoldt2015experimental.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by Randy Ewoldt.

<h2>Graphs</h2>

All graphs that are put in any publication, report, or presentation, including any data that you send to me to see, must be made in MATLAB until further notice.  Assuming that the data is obtained from an external measurement, the figure must be accompanied by a data file (e.g., .csv, .xlsx, etc.) and the associate m-file when providing me the figure.  This m-file needs to produce the exact figure that you are sending without any GUI interaction.   

<br /><br />

In an effort to make our figures consistent, use the following <a href="/secure/code/set_default_plot_properties.m.zip">m-file</a> to set the default plot properties.

<h2>Papers</h2>

All articles will be named as exemplified by walker2015multiphase.pdf, where we will use the last name of the first author, the year of publication, and the first significant word of the title to designate the file.  This designation will also be used for our citations.

<h2>Publications</h2>

All publications will be completed in LaTeX.  Unless planning a submission to a specific journal, we will default to use the revtex document class that is used by AIP, APS, and others.

<br />
<br />

If you are using a Mac, TexShop is a relatively easy way to use LaTeX.  Another option for LaTeX is to use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank">Overleaf</a>, which provides a shareable document interface that is housed online; this interface is convenient for collaborative writing and editing.

<br />
<br />

Once you have access to LaTeX, the easiest way to get started is to download the following packages at the following websites.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex" target="_blank">revtex package</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib" target="_blank">natbib package</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Citations</h2>

All documents will use BibTeX to create their reference.  One master BIB-file will be continuously updated so that we do not need to redo work.  I will update the file periodically.

<ul>
<li><a href="/secure/files/master.bib.zip" target="_blank">master</a></li>
<li><a href="/secure/files/walker_group.bib.zip" target="_blank">walker_group</a></li>
</ul>

We will default to use the natbib package that is used for bibliographic management.

<br /><br />

As an example, by performing a search in <a href="scholar.google.com" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> for the following title:

<br /><br />

"Walker, T.W., A.N. Logia, G.G. Fuller. Multiphase flow of miscible liquids: jets and drops. Exp. Fluids. 56, 106 (2015)."

<br /><br />

you will be given a number of  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Walker%2C+T.W.%2C+A.N.+Logia%2C+G.G.+Fuller.+Multiphase+flow+of+miscible+liquids%3A+jets+and+drops.+Exp.+Fluids.+56%2C+106+%282015%29.+&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5" target="_blank">links</a> under the file name.  For a particular link, if you choose "cite," a pop-up menu will appear.  If you choose "BibTex" at the bottom, a new <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar.bib?q=info:l-73mr3yAvUJ:scholar.google.com/&output=citation&scisig=AAGBfm0AAAAAVr0Qv3AC_f5LWV-iuAHQpvSwf4NwVGTn&scisf=4&hl=en" target="_blank">page</a> will load with the following information.

<br /><br />

@article{walker2015multiphase,
  title={Multiphase flow of miscible liquids: jets and drops},
  author={Walker, Travis W and Logia, Alison N and Fuller, Gerald G},
  journal={Experiments in Fluids},
  volume={56},
  number={5},
  pages={1--14},
  year={2015},
  publisher={Springer}
}

<br />
<br />

This information can then be copied and pasted into the BIB-file.  Note that the article name is the same as our article naming convention.

<h2>Reports</h2>

All reports will be completed in LaTeX.  We will work together to make a default template that will be used by everyone.

<h2>Presentations</h2>

All presentations can be completed in any format that is desired; however, format of materials given in the presentations will need to meet expectations.  Note that LaTeX does have a presentation package called Beamer that is quite nice.

<h2>Posters</h2>

All posters need to be submitted to me for penultimate review at least 48-hours prior to the print-submission deadline.  If you do not understand the word "penultimate," look it up.
