<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>Newton’s laws of motion apply to everything including particles, irrespective of their sizes. Particle dynamics are being influenced by external forces (for example, gravitational force, earth’s magnetic force, etc.) that are present in their environment. My interest is to investigate how these dynamics change with the amount of force that is exerted on the particles to make them move in specific ways. Since these dynamics are being used in sensitive fields like pharmaceuticals, nano/microbiology, etc., accurate predictions of these dynamics are required.  Thus, as a group, we develop models that incorporate all of the forces to accurately predict the dynamics of the particles.</p>

<p>In cellular growth, the dynamics of the cells in a reactor, such as a rotating wall vessel, can be influenced by Brownian forces, drag forces, wall forces, centrifugal forces, and gravitational forces. These dynamics can have great impact on the growth rate, the nutrient uptake, and the mortality rate of the cells. I am interested in investigating how these forces affect the movement, the collective behavior, and the growth rate of various cell shapes and sizes in these reactors. Identifying the impact that these forces have on the cells would help to improve their growth quality, enhance selective growth, and aid in designing advanced reactors with more efficient operating regimes.</p>
