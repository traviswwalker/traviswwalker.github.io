<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVG) in the small-diameter range (1-6 mm) have been developmentally elusive because of high rates of occlusion and stenosis.  The criteria for the ideal TEVG has been established; however, an ideal TEVG has yet to be obtained.  Criteria include having the ability to be remodeled, avoiding induction of chronic inflammation, exhibiting proper mechanical properties, and allowing suturing to host vessels.  We are interested in developing a TEVG that is composed of natural materials, while meeting the criteria of an ideal TEVG that is clinically translatable.</p>

<p>TEVGs that are derived from natural materials have a history of insufficient mechanical properties. However, through the advancement of biomimetic systems, natural TEVGs can be remodeled by cells, resulting in living tissues with improved mechanical properties.  Our research objective is to induce chemotactic cellular homing to the scaffold causing an in vitro, angiogenic, healing-like response. Through maturation, we seek to grow a TEVG with comparable endothelialization and elastic fiber generation to native vessels.  The in vitro generation of elastic fibers by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that emulate an artery in vivo has been a significant challenge.  Implementation of 3D printing allows for precise control of vessel fiber geometry, allowing us to replicate actual tissue structures and proper cell orientation.  Coupled with the correct chemical and physical environment, we anticipate that this biomimetic environment will produce a clinically translatable TEVG.</p>
